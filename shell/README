Shell Project

-----README-----

***Command for making using Makefile:
make -f makefile.c 

***Command for clean using Makefile:
make -f makefile.c clean 

need to have yacc and lex installed for program to work

***Known issues and bugs with shell executable:
1.  When piping multiple commands MANUALLY, shell executes properly but exits with issue: "input in flex scanner failed"
2.  Using wild card only yields first file found (instead of all files meeting that criteria)
3.  Setenv does not expand
4.  An environment variable in a string does not concatenate with a second string such as ${LIB}/libxc.a
5.  Issues with file redirection to ./shell
